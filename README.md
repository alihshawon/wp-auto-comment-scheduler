# WP Auto Comment Scheduler

A smart and customizable WordPress plugin that automatically posts **predefined comments from predefined (demo) users** at scheduled intervals on selected posts. Designed to simulate realistic user engagement — with full control over time, randomness (tolerance), and comment limits.

## 🔥 Features

- ✅ **User Selection**  
  Assign one or more demo users to comment on specific or all posts.

- 💬 **Custom Comment Content**  
  Add and edit multiline, long-form comments for each selected user.

- ⏱️ **Interval + Randomness (Tolerance)**  
  Set base time interval between each comment, and apply an optional tolerance percentage to randomize the delay — making the activity appear more human-like.

- 🧠 **Comment Limits**  
  Define maximum number of comments per post and per user for precision control.

- 🗓️ **Scheduled (Future) Post Support**  
  Comments are also posted on future/published posts using the same timing logic.
